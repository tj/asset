## Examples

### Installing Several Assets

 By default asset installs to `./public`.

      $ asset raphael g.raphael g.pie

       install : raphael@1.4.7
       install : g.raphael@0.4.1
       install : g.pie@0.4.1
      download : raphael@1.4.7
      complete : raphael@1.4.7 public/raphael.js
      download : g.raphael@0.4.1
      complete : g.raphael@0.4.1 public/g.raphael.js
      download : g.pie@0.4.1
      complete : g.pie@0.4.1 public/g.pie.js

### Install Destination

  Tweak the output directory with `-o, --out <dir>`.

      $ asset raphael g.raphael g.pie -o public/javascripts

       install : raphael@1.4.7
       install : g.raphael@0.4.1
       install : g.pie@0.4.1
      download : raphael@1.4.7
      complete : raphael@1.4.7 public/javascripts/raphael.js
      download : g.raphael@0.4.1
      complete : g.raphael@0.4.1 public/javascripts/g.raphael.js
      download : g.pie@0.4.1
      complete : g.pie@0.4.1 public/javascripts/g.pie.js

### Search Repository

 We can search the repository with an optional query, listing
 available assets and their default versions:
 
     $ asset raphael

      install : raphael@1.4.7
     download : raphael@1.4.7
     complete : raphael@1.4.7 public/raphael.js

### Configuration

 By default options must be passed via the CLI, however `asset` will also check the `./.asset` and `~/.asset` JSON configuration files, so for example a project may set `{ "out": "public/javascripts" }` if we are mainly working with javascript, however the CLI options will always take precedence.

### The Repository

 By default the repo bundled with `asset` is used, however the `~/.assets` configuration file is checked first. Perhaps down the road if/when asset becomes more flexible a repo will be hosted, for now simply fork the project edit `./assets.json`, and send a pull request.
